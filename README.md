## Key Projects 
- Quality Flow Anomaly Detection System (QFAS): Developed a QFAS using Python and Flask for a user-friendly interface, integrated Great Expectations for data quality assurance, employed AWS services (S3, EC2, CloudWatch), PostgreSQL for data storage, Apache Druid for real-time analytics, and Dagster for workflow orchestration. Addressing the anomaly detection as a classification problem, decision tree algorithm was applied to build predictive models, ensuring timely anomaly detection and minimizing downtime, thus optimizing product quality and operational efficiency.
- AI/ML-based Supply Chain Demand Forecasting: Led end-to-end supply chain demand forecasting project, employing AI/ML techniques for inventory optimization. Integrated diverse data using ETL tools, deployed models with TensorFlow/Keras, deployed on AWS/GCP, and maintained with robust monitoring and CI/CD pipelines. Enhanced accuracy, minimized stockouts, and boosted customer satisfaction through collaboration across teams.
Renewable Energy Monitoring Platform (REMP): Utilized an IoT-based solution aimed at providing comprehensive monitoring and analysis of renewable energy systems. As a Developer/Architect, the primary responsibility involves developing and integrating data pipelines from ground devices to databases, application development using Django, and constructing RESTful APIs. Additionally, the role entails DevOps responsibilities for deploying the complete application on the Google Cloud platform.
- IOT based reporting tool: Engineered, designed, and implemented an IoT-powered Reporting Tool, extracting, transforming, and loading data from dataloggers into InfluxDB using NEM standards, while generating reports in XLSX, PDF, and HTML formats, and distributing them via email, powered by Python, .NET Core, Angular, Airflow, PySpark, InfluxDB, Docker, and Amazon Cloud services.
- E-commerce Module Enhancement and Optimization: Developed and architected, encompassing extended permissions and return product features. Caching was configured using Aerospike, and existing components were optimized. The technologies employed included Django, MySQL, RabbitMQ, and Angular, deployed on Amazon Cloud infrastructure with RDS, S3, and EC2 services.
- Efficient Project Description Tool & Management: Engineered and architected a Project Description Tool & Management system, integrating Python, MySQL, jQuery, AJAX, HTML, and CSS within the Laravel framework. Designed for content processing and management, empowering clients and project managers to efficiently process and share content.
